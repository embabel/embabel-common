/**
 * Represents the author of a message in a conversation.
 *
 * This interface provides a persistence-agnostic abstraction for user identity

 *
 * ## Usage
 *
 * For simple cases, use the provided [SimpleMessageAuthor] data class:
 * ```kotlin
 * val author = SimpleMessageAuthor(id = "user-123", displayName = "Alice")
 * conversation.addMessageFrom(message, author)
 * ```
