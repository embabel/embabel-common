# embabel-platform.properties
#
# This file participates in Cross-JAR Property Discovery.
# Same-named files from all modules (direct and transitive dependencies) 
# will be automatically discovered and merged with hierarchical precedence.
#
# Platform-level configuration: core infrastructure, framework settings,
# deployment environments, and foundational system properties.
#
# Modules can provide their own embabel-platform.properties files that will:
# - Be automatically discovered via classpath* scanning  
# - Be merged using depth-based hierarchy (deeper JARs override shallower)
# - Provide module-specific platform configuration
#
# See CrossJarPropertiesUtil and CrossJarPropertiesConfiguration for details.
#
# Current actual properties are defined in other modules that depend on this
