# embabel-application.properties
#
# This file participates in Cross-JAR Property Discovery.
# Same-named files from all modules (direct and transitive dependencies)
# will be automatically discovered and merged with hierarchical precedence.
#
# Application-level configuration: business logic settings, feature toggles,
# application-specific behavior, and user-facing functionality.
#
# Modules can provide their own embabel-application.properties files that will:
# - Be automatically discovered via classpath* scanning
# - Be merged using depth-based hierarchy (deeper JARs override shallower)
# - Provide module-specific application configuration
#
# See CrossJarPropertiesUtil and CrossJarPropertiesConfiguration for details.
#
# Current actual properties are defined in other modules that depend on this core.
